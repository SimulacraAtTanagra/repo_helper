## The purpose of this project is as follows:
This program assists users in creating well-formed github repoistories procedurally.
## Here's some back story on why I needed to build this:
In order to tackle a backlog of github updates, I've put together this program to help me quickly create repositories and upload them to github. This will allow me to meet my goal of uploading all extant code by the end of April 2021 in a way which does not compromise the integrity of my portfolio as a whole. 



The expected frequency for running this code is As Needed.
